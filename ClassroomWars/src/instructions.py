    1. You can play against another player or the computer.
    2. Choose a character with unique abilities. Each character has different strengths and weaknesses.
    3. Stats to watch:
       - **Health**: Your life points. If it hits 0, you lose.
       - **Stamina**: Energy used for skills and items. Don't run out!
       - **Shield**: Protects you by absorbing damage before it affects your health.

    - Each player takes turns. During your turn, you can:
      1. **Use a Skill**: Perform an action like attacking, healing, or shielding.
      2. **Use an Item**: Buff yourself, deal damage, or recover stamina.
      3. **Surrender**: If you can't continue, you can give up the match.
      
    - Plan your moves wisely:
      - Use attacks to reduce your opponent's shield or health.
      - Defend yourself with shields or recover with healing skills.
      - Conserve stamina! Without stamina, you can't act.

    print("""
    1. Players cannot pick the same character. If the computer selects randomly, it ensures it's different.
    2. Damage goes to the shield first before affecting health.
    3. Items also consume stamina, so use them carefully.
    4. The game ends when one player's health reaches 0 or someone surrenders.
